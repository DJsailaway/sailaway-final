          Enjoy traditional sailing on the Helford River with our fleet of dayboats and dinghies. Our sailing boats are available to any party with a competent sailor, while our motorboats can be booked by total novices or experienced boatmen alike. We offer a varied fleet of motor and sailboats, and are able to offer delivery to all points along the Helford River. Visitors can take a short hop up the river for a couple of hours, or reserve a boat for a week or two to immerse themselves in this wonderful Cornish tradition. Of course, our boats are supplied with fuel, with all the requisite safety equipment and are fully licensed and insured. With well over a century of experience handling boats on the Helford, we aim to take any hassle out of your time afloat, and will show you how to rig and use the boat and give you a few tips on where to go before you set off on your own adventure.
